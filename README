         The goal of ember-responsive is to give you a simple, Ember-aware way
         of dealing with media queries. All you need to do is tell it your
         application's breakpoints and it'll expose the rest for you.


         Getting Started
         ~──────────────

         Fortunately, ember-responsive is dead-simple to set up. You can start
         by adding it to your list of bower dependencies:

            $ bower install --save ember-responsive

         After that, simply register the media queries that are pertinent
         to your application.

            App = Ember.Application.extend();

            // Add the following initializer wherever you create your App class,
            // giving it a list of named breakpoints that your app responds to.
            App.responsive({
              media: {
                mobile:  '(max-width: 768px)',
                tablet:  '(min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 992px)',
                desktop: '(min-width: 993px) and (max-width: 1200px)',
                jumbo:   '(min-width: 1201px)',
              }
            });

         You can then query those breakpoints in your controllers, components,
         routes, and views:

            this.get('media.isMobile'); // => true

         Obviously, these properties also propagate to templates:

            {{#if media.isDesktop}}
              Desktop view!
            {{/if}}

         You should also bind the list of active media queries to your app's
         rootElement. This means you won't have to deal with complicated media
         queries in CSS—instead simply use classes to style the different devices.

            App.ApplicationView = Ember.View.extend({
              classNameBindings: ['media.classNames']
            });


         Tests

         To run the tests, after cloning do:

           * `npm install`
           * `bower install`
           * `grunt test`
